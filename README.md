# Hi, I'm Yashashvi Saraan 👋
## 🔥 Featured Project: Flight Delay Prediction ✈️

Flight delays significantly impact passengers, airlines, and the global economy.  
This project leverages **machine learning** and **deep learning** to accurately predict flight delays using historical flight data, weather information, and air traffic data.  

### 🔍 Key Features
- Data preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering
- Models implemented:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Deep Learning Neural Network (TensorFlow, Keras)
- Achieved **99% accuracy** with deep learning models
- Visualized results using **heatmaps**, **confusion matrices**, and **Seaborn plots**
